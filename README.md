# my-crawler

Project skeleton generated by Crawlee (Beautifulsoup template).

## Usage

To get started, ensure you have [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), a package and dependency management system, installed on your machine. We recommend installing it with the following command:

```sh
pipx install uv
```

Next, install the project dependencies:

```sh
uv sync
```

Finally, launch the crawler with:

```sh
uv run python -m my_crawler
```
